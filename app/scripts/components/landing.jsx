              Like most baseball fans history and stats are something that we like to follow
              and keep up with. As an fan you always love watching a player hit a homerun,
              espically if that player is one of your favorites.
              <br />
              Seeing those players hit a home run was only half of the enjoyment for me. Watching
              a lucky fan catch that home run and celebrate like he hit himself has always brought
              me joy. What if there was a way to increase your odds in catching that homerun you
              have always been wanting to.
              <br />
              In comes Shelf, an application design to keep track of homeruns once they have
              been caught and gone to souvenir city. Shelf is a place to keep track of your homeruns
              that you have caught as well as seeing other users and the homeruns they have caught.

              Watching my favorite team play the yankees in 2015, I saw history being made
              right before my eyes. Alex Rodriguez hit a homerun for his 3,000th hit off of
              Justin Verlander of the Detroit Tigers. What made this moment more historic was
              the fan that caught the ball. He placed himself in the best position to catch that ball.
              <br />
              Zack Hample has caught more than 8,000 baseballs and even wrote a book about it.
              He posts video on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/zackhample">YouTube</a> of
              him catching and visiting ballparks all across America. He even shares his moments
              and thoughts on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/zack_hample">Twitter</a> about his
              adventures catching souvenirs.
              <br />
              This is the catch that got me thinking about an application of tracking homeruns caught.
              <blockquote className="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s A-Rod&#39;s 3,000th hit/ball. Told the <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Yankees">@Yankees</a> I&#39;m keeping it. Got it authenticated by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/MLB">@MLB</a>. This is un-REAL.

              There are a few features we can offer. You can search by date to find a list
              of games and once you find the game you were at you will be able to click it,
              once clicked it will show all the home runs, if any, hit for that game. You
              will then be shown a form to fill out some information to help us track where
              people are sitting in the stadium when the ball was caught.
